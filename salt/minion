# File directory settings
#
# The Salt Minon can redirect all file server operations to a local directory,
# this allows for the same state tree that is on the master to be used if
# copied completely onto the minion.
#

# The client defaults to looking on the master server for files, but can be
# directed to look at the local file directory setting defined below by setting
# it to "local". Setting a local file_client runs the minion in masterless mode.
file_client: local

# The file directory works on environments passed to the minion, each
# environment can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the
# multiple file roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be
# able to be reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top
# file.

  base:
    - /srv/salt
