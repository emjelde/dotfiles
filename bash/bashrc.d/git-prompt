# If you would like to see the difference between HEAD and its upstream,
# set GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM="auto".  A "<" indicates you are behind, ">"
# indicates you are ahead, "<>" indicates you have diverged and "="
# indicates that there is no difference. You can further control
# behaviour by setting GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM to a space-separated list
# of values:
#
#     verbose       show number of commits ahead/behind (+/-) upstream
#     name          if verbose, then also show the upstream abbrev name
#     legacy        don't use the '--count' option available in recent
#                   versions of git-rev-list
#     git           always compare HEAD to @{upstream}
#     svn           always compare HEAD to your SVN upstream
#
# You can change the separator between the branch name and the above
# state symbols by setting GIT_PS1_STATESEPARATOR. The default separator
# is SP.
#
# By default, __git_ps1 will compare HEAD to your SVN upstream if it can
# find one, or @{upstream} otherwise.  Once you have set
# GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM, you can override it on a per-repository basis by
# setting the bash.showUpstream config variable.
