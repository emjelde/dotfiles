# This file provides examples of environment variables which are sourced by the
# Makefile to override default configuration for the Gentoo base system and
# virtual machine instances created by Packer.
#
# Do not edit this file, instead make changes in a copy of this file named
# `.env`.

# The number of virtual CPUs for the virtual machine. Default is the number of
# installed processors.
#
# See gentoo/gentoo-vm-vars for more information on how this is used.
#
#CPUS=12

# The amount of RAM, in MB, that the virtual machine should allocate for itself
# from the host. Default is about 1.5 GiB per CPU.

# Gentoo downloads can be retrieved from many mirrors around the globe.
# Selecting a mirror that is geographically near you may help speed up
# downloads.
#
# The source (distfile) mirror is used for fetching installation files as well
# as package sources.
#
# This configures GENTOO_MIRRORS in /etc/portage/make.conf and can be modified
# there afterwards.
#
# For a list of Gentoo source mirrors see:
#    https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/
#
# Uses mirrorselect if value is empty.

#
# The rsync mirror is used for updating the Portage tree. The rsync mirror
# configures /etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf during the build and can be
# modified there afterwards.
#
# For a list of rsync mirrors see:

#RSYNC_MIRROR=rsync://rsync.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage

# Mirror used for the stage 3 base system files and Portage snapshot.
